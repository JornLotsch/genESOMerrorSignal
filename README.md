# genESOM Data Processing Pipeline
## ðŸš§ Project Status: Under Development ðŸš§
This repository contains a comprehensive data preparation and analysis pipeline specifically designed for augmenting research data using a neural network based generative AI (genESOM). The project is currently in active development.
## Overview
This pipeline offers a robust framework for processing, transforming, and analyzing biomedical data. It's designed to handle common challenges in omics data including outlier detection, missing value imputation, and data normalization.
## Key Features
- **Distribution exploration** with automated visualization
- **Intelligent transformation selection** using:
    - Tukey's ladder of powers
    - Box-Cox transformations

- **Outlier detection and removal** using:
    - Grubbs' test
    - Boxplot method

- **Missing value imputation** using missForest algorithm
- of data to original scale **Back-transformation**
- **Parallel processing** support for improved performance

## Dependencies
The pipeline requires several R packages:
- readr, ggplot2, ComplexHeatmap
- missForest, forecast, outliers, nortest
- parallel, devtools (for installing ABCstats)
- ABCstats (installed from GitHub)

## Configuration
The pipeline is highly configurable, allowing you to control:
- Data exploration options
- Transformation methods
- Outlier detection parameters
- Missing value handling
- Parallel processing settings

## Getting Started
**Note**: Detailed installation and usage instructions will be added as development progresses.
## Roadmap
- [ ] Complete data transformation modules
- [ ] Add visualization components
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add example datasets
- [ ] Build test suite
- [ ] Create user-friendly interface

## Contributing
As this project is still under development, contribution guidelines will be established in the near future. Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature requests.
